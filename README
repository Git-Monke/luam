- Single command installation / deletion of packages and recursive installation / deletion of their dependencies

- Semantic versioning support allowing package writers to depend on the most up to date versions of their dependencies without having to specify exact versions
- Single command updating of all packages and their dependencies
- Optimized dependency trees that reduce code duplication, but allow for multiple non-compatible versions of the same package to be depended upon safely.
